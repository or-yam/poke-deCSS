### Used [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) for the data

> The [Pokédex](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/) is a fictional electronic device designed to catalogue and provide information regarding the various species of Pokémon featured in the Pokémon video game, anime and manga series. The name Pokédex is a neologism including "Pokémon" (which itself is a portmanteau of "pocket" and "monster") and "index".
